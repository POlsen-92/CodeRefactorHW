 For this Assignment I was given a webpage which required some adjustments in the code. The primary objectives were to improve accessibility for anyone viewing the webpage. Secondary objectives included cleaning and consolidating the code within HTML and CSS in order to improve readability and make maintenance easier.

## Client Story

- AS A marketing agency
- I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
- SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the icon and image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Content Changes

- Addition of titles and alternative descriptions to images to allow for screen reading
- Removal of generic HTML syntax (div) into specific, semantic HTML elements (Figures, nav, section)
- Adjusted headings so that they follow sequential order
- Added informative title
- In the CSS code repetition was cut so that readability is enhanced
- For both HTML and CSS comments were added to improve understanding of the code's purpose
